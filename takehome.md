# Prompt:
Expand your solution by including automated tests. Cover API endpoints, input validation, and edge cases.

## Guidelines for Testing:

### Testing Coverage
- Include tests for all major API endpoints and core functionality.
- Aim to cover edge cases and validate how the system handles invalid or unexpected inputs.

### Test Structure & Clarity
- Organize tests clearly and use descriptive names that convey their intent.
- Use a standard Python testing framework such as pytest or unittest.

### Automation & Execution
- Ensure tests can be run easily, such as with pytest or a make test command.
- Provide clear instructions for running the tests in a README or test-related documentation.

### Quality of Assertions
- Use meaningful assertions that test both expected behavior and failure modes.
- Cover both positive (successful) and negative (error-handling) paths to ensure robustness.
